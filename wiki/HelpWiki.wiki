= Contributing to the wiki =

The wiki `googlecode` has the function to have pages in multiple languages. We invite you to contribute and translate the documentation in your native language.

You can contribute to the wiki as follows:
  * Adding comment pages.
  * Modifying the content of the pages (via svn) and sending the patch through the section of `issues`.

== Translating the wiki == 
To translate the documentation into your native language you must first obtain a copy of the wiki pages. Let's get the latest version of pages via the following command `svn`.
{{{
svn checkout http://spotshout.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ spotSHOUT-Wiki
}}}

Now create a folder with your language code. See [# http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax Localizing_Wiki_Content here for the full list of availables languages].

Copy the files and now just translate each file.
To send, create an `issue` with the patch attached.
