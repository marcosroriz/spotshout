#summary Building the project from source code.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Building spotSHOUT =
spotSHOUT is divided into two subprojects: the middleware and plug-in for `NetBeans`. We will teach you how to get the code and build the subprojects.

== spotSHOUT Middleware ==
=== Getting the source code ===
For the latest version (in development) use your `svn` client and run the following command:
{{{
svn checkout-http://spotshout.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/spotSHOUT spotSHOUT Middleware
}}}
After getting the code you can open the project directly in `NetBeans`.

Compiling the source code === ===
Enter the folder spotSHOUT-Middleware and run the `jar-app` task of `ant`, ie, the command below:
{{{
ant jar-app
}}}
The middleware will be built in the `build` folder with the name `spotSHOUT-VERSAO.jar`.

=== Modifying Properties ===
To enable `debug` and other properties such as `timeout` time modify the class *`com.google.code.spotshout.RMIProperties`* to your taste. After that, recompile the `middleware`.

== SpotSHOUT Plug-in == 
=== Getting the source code ===
For the latest version (in development) use your `svn` client and run the following command:
{{{
svn checkout http://spotshout.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/spotSHOUT-NB spotSHOUT-Plugin
}}}
After getting the code you can open the project directly in `NetBeans`.

Compiling the source code === ===
In `NetBeans` open the project and click build, or run the `nbm` `ant` task:
{{{
ant nbm
}}}
The plug-in will be built in the `build` folder with the name `com-google-code-spotshout-nb.nbm`.
